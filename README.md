# Macro/Nutrition Meal and Grocery List Builder

### Presentation Description/Overview
#### Problem
Putting together a weekly meal plan can be rough when you’re an athlete.  You need to make sure your hitting your daily macros (protein, carb, fat) and you might get bored eating the same thing every day.  When it comes to making that weekly ingredient list, it’s tough to make sure you don’t forget anything and you get the right quantities.

#### Solution
The goal of this project is to set up a recipe database where a user can build a weekly menu by picking ingredients or recipes from the database.  Picking food will populate a menu and grocery list with quantities.  The daily menu will include the total macros planned for the day. Users will also be able to enter their own recipes into the db.

#### Extension or possible second or third release:
Eventually, users will be able to calculate their BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and select options (maintain, bulk, cut) and the DB can suggest calorie and macro estimates based on the type of athlete.  (example: Runners make gains on high carb diets while lifters make gains on high protein diets).

#### Pages and functionality:
* Pages will include: weekly menu, weekly grocery list, recipes, user info
* User info page is where the user will be able to set up their personal information and targets for macros/calories
* Weekly Grocery list will show items and quantities needed for the week’s menu
* Weekly menu will show a total of the macros for each day as well as the names of the recipes.
* The recipes page will allow users to browse all recipes in the DB or by ingredient.  A user can select recipes to add to their menu or add a new recipe.
